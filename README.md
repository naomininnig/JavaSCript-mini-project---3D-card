# JavaScript-mini-project---3d-Card

Final Project for Progreming Basics Module - Web Development Course 2021 DCI.
https://naomininnig.github.io/JavaScript-mini-project---3d-Card/

The final project was to write a small program and to assemble in it the basic JavaScript functions.
I decided to create a recipe that calculates the amount of ingredients per the amount of people the user intend to cook for.
I also made a function that converts the measurements of the recipe ingredients (from grams to liquid).
Along with a 3D card animation to make things a bit more interesting.
In my project I used:

-DOM manipulation
-onClick Events
-Advanced functions
-Animations

Our Project was to use only JS but i belive it is a bit more intresting to have it on the browser and see the result with HTML and CSS 

It's nothing to crazy but i hope you will enjoy it!
